# Facial_Expression_Classification
Facial Expression Classification Using Residual Neural Networks.

In this project from Coursera Project Network, we build a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to detect facial expressions. This project can be practically used for detecting customer emotions and facial expressions.
